# Overnet Floret Filter (Chrome and Firefox Extension)
Censors bad words into softer ones for little sprouts.
Comes with two filters:
* Only filter swear words
* Filter all words that could be hard for a little sprout to read (eg; the word hate, or topics around capitalism)

Just unpack this as a chrome extension and it should work ^_^

The firefox extension requires self signing and compiling into a .XPI file for it to actually be used in the firefox browser. 
Have fun :3
